# COMP3000: Multi-Site Manga Reader
## **<u>Project Vision</u>**
The project is to create an application that will allow fans of manga to view manga from a selection of sites. It will allow users to favourite manga to their liking and be informed of updates. The underlying aim is to ensure the original translation teams still get traffic revenue while the reader has an easier experience switching between sites. 
## **<u>Objectives</u>**
- Create an android app using kotlin
- Load multiple manga sites
- Display the manga selected
- Allow users to favourite manga
- Display notifications when favourites update
## **<u>User Stories</u>**
- As a reader I want to be able to access manga
- As a reader I want to be able to save my favourites
- As a reader I want to be notified of new updates
- As a translator I want to be acknowledged for my work
- As a translator I want to recieve revenue for my work
